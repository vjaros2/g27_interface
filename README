This is a simple C program that uses ioctl to open up the event file associated with a logitech g27 steering wheel controller and send force feedback events.

USAGE:

Run as SUDO!

compile and run like this:
	./a.out [event number to open] [tolerance (20-500)] [position to move to(16384 max)] [ff strength (16384 max)]
	
	Event number is unique to your steering wheel.
	Tolerance affects both accuracy and precision. Play around with it but I find anything from 150-350 works pretty well.
	Position determines where the wheel is supposed to go. Remeber there are 900 degrees or rotation. 16384 is all the way right, 0 is all the way left.
	Strength is the speed at which your wheel will initially move at. Faster is less precise, but still pretty accurate. I use a value of 8192 typically. It's fast and precise.
	
I intend to use this to present a cool visual representation of the current wheel position in a driving game. If I can eventually get around to autonomous steering inputs in GTA V, this would be a neat way to display the current wheel postion: by physically turning it with force feedback.
